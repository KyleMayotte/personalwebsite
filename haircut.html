  <h2>Haircut</h2>
  <p>I was spending around $30 every haircut, which I thought was ridculous. I thought to myself it can't be that hard. So I did it. This was the final product of my first cut with many more to come. Cutting hair is like an art; constantly perfecting it, observing others, and developing new techniques. </p>
